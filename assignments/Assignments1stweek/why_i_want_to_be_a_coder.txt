When I took my first computer class it was unfolded to me that I could make any tool I desired and then I dreamed of a world of creations. 
And with programming I could make these ideas tangible to others. This is why I embarked on my way to program everyday.
Programming is a gift to those who pursue it. What I have come to understand is that we learn to learn. 
We learn a syntax and straggle through some projects and then it clicks. 
We spent so much time learning that you learn to research, understand, and apply. We can pick up new languages in a snap because We know what to look for, We know what questions to ask or how to phrase them. 
We learn how to read documentation and analyze code that We can understand more advance concepts. Its a gift that keeps on giving because its forged in hard work.
